## Additional testing notes

### **Testing Methodology**

Each wallet was tested using the most recent versions available as of writing this report, across both iOS and Android platforms and browser extensions. Solana Pay functionality was evaluated by generating test QR codes for payments and observing how each wallet handled flexibility, scan speed, transaction clarity, and approval ease.

### General Findings:

- Phantom, Solflare, and Backpack instantly detected and interpreted Solana Pay QR codes without needing a browser redirect. They provided clear transaction previews and fast confirmation flows.
- Solflare and Okx has the highest transaction fee compared to the other tested wallets.
- Okx wallet is regional bias thus making it restricted to some regions. It worked but introduced minor friction with app switching. It however works very smoothly on mobile than browser.
- **Trust Wallet** required users to manually open a dApp browser, making QR scanning less intuitive.
- **Exodus Mobile** was the most beginner-friendly for Solana Pay, with a dedicated section for QR payments. Also the easiest to setup.
- Bitget has the unique interface and smooth solana pay walk through where you can either scan or import QR code images.
- Backpack is highly underrated.
- Solflare has the simplest steps in using QR code solana pay.

### Issues Encountered:

- Some wallet (Okx) struggled to parse QR codes unless the camera was centered precisely.
- Phantom’s desktop extension version did not support camera QR scanning. Only the mobile app worked.
- Cross-app redirection behavior varied on Android vs iOS, particularly affecting Trust Wallet and Okx.

### Recommendations:

- Developers and Users should prefer **Phantom, Solflare, or Backpack** for smoother QR usage.
- Wallets like Backpack and are promising but need UI polish for enterprise use.

These notes were compiled for wallet usage, covering 7 wallets and several Solana Pay test scans.
